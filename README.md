# golang-beginner-tutorial

First steps of getting into Golang. This application is all about making first steps with golang.
The goal was to build a quiz, getting used to the syntax and get a basic understanding. 
Within the main function you get asked to enter your name and age. 
If you are old enough you are allowed to play you get asked only 2 questions and the correct answers get stored within 'score'
which gets printed to the console after you finished.
